Drafts that i wrote while learning exploitation stuff. They are commented (most of the time) and i use to relearn some techniques and concepts.

They are bad coded (the news ones are getting better) and (most of the time) not good examples, be aware. Maybe someday i will sort it out in a better way, dont get your hopes up.
